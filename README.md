 # [Checkpoint 2 : Learning the Project Language - Java]

 - Java is one of the standard languages for developing Android applications.
 - We too would be using Java for developing this project.

Installation and Setup

 - For using Java on your local machines, you'll need to install JDK(Java Development Kit) which can be downloaded from here:  https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/install/overview-jdk-installation.html
 - For practising the syntax of Java, you can use Eclipse or any other standard compiler like VsCode that supports Java. Online compilers like Ideone, Online GDB would also serve the prupose.
- You can watch this video: https://youtu.be/Hl-zzrqQoSE if you need help with JDK installation.

Resources to learn Java

 - Following concepts of Java are required to be learned for this project:
-- Basic syntax of the language(data-types, syntax of arrays, print and scan methods,how to write functions, etc.)

 -- Object Oriented Programming Concepts(OOPs): Syntax of defining a class, access specifiers(private-public-protected), Polymorphism, inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation, getter and setter methods

 -- Basics of Exception Handling: Significance of try, catch and finally blocks while handling an exception

 -  https://www.w3schools.com/java/   [Focus on the concepts mentioned above]

-  Video Link: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE2CE09D83EE3E28 [ Video 4 - 42 and 82 ]

    Following only ONE of the above two tutorials shall serve the purpose of our project.

Deadline to complete Checkpoint 2: January 8(Friday) 6 AM

# [Checkpoint 3 : Getting started with some basic apps]

 - If you're done with checkpoint 2, finally it's time to get started with our "Hello World" and basic applications
 - We would be using Android Studio for developing our applications which is the official IDE designed specifically for Android Development.

## Installation and Setup

- Before installing Android Studio, make sure you already have JDK installed in your machines. (Checkpoint 2)
 - Android Studio can be downloaded from here: https://developer.android.com/studio
- You can watch this video: https://youtu.be/InigFUSiPl8 if you need help with Android Studio installation.
Resources to learn 

 - Following concepts of Android are to be learned in this checkpoint:
-- creating your first 'hello world' app and getting familiar with Android Studio
-- Running this "Hello World" app on Android Emulator/Physical Device.
(Learn how to use Android emulator and how can we do USB debugging with physical device. What are advantages of using one over the other ?)
-- Linear Layout and Relative Layout
-- Android Activity and Activity Lifecycle
-- How to use images in our app, how to connect UI with Java logic, etc. (focus on just on single screen app for now)

 -  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9aiL0kysYlfSOUgY5rNlOhUd   [Video: 1 - 5, (6 is optional)] 

Above playlist is best in our opinion to learn the concepts required for this checkpoint, but if you want some supplementary resources, you can go through the following links too:

-- https://youtu.be/fis26HvvDII This is a good tutorial to get started with Android if you are not comfortable with Hindi tutorial link given above. 

-- https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBsvRxJJOzG4r4k_zLKrnxl This playlist systematically covers different concepts of Android but it uses a bit outdated version of Android Studio. So don't rely on this completely and try to use this playlist only as a supplementary material when you are unclear with some particular topic.
