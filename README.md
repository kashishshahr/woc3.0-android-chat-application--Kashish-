 # [Checkpoint 2 : Learning the Project Language - Java]

 - Java is one of the standard languages for developing Android applications.
 - We too would be using Java for developing this project.

Installation and Setup

 - For using Java on your local machines, you'll need to install JDK(Java Development Kit) which can be downloaded from here:  https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/install/overview-jdk-installation.html
 - For practising the syntax of Java, you can use Eclipse or any other standard compiler like VsCode that supports Java. Online compilers like Ideone, Online GDB would also serve the prupose.
- You can watch this video: https://youtu.be/Hl-zzrqQoSE if you need help with JDK installation.

Resources to learn Java

 - Following concepts of Java are required to be learned for this project:
-- Basic syntax of the language(data-types, syntax of arrays, print and scan methods,how to write functions, etc.)

 -- Object Oriented Programming Concepts(OOPs): Syntax of defining a class, access specifiers(private-public-protected), Polymorphism, inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation, getter and setter methods

 -- Basics of Exception Handling: Significance of try, catch and finally blocks while handling an exception

 -  https://www.w3schools.com/java/   [Focus on the concepts mentioned above]

-  Video Link: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE2CE09D83EE3E28 [ Video 4 - 42 and 82 ]

    Following only ONE of the above two tutorials shall serve the purpose of our project.

Deadline to complete Checkpoint 2: January 8(Friday) 6 AM
